There is probably a more efficient way to implement these changes, but for now, the following works when updating your github page using the blogdown R package:

1. Create/Edit the files in source directory (e.g. in RStudio or Windows)
2. In RStudio, run blogdown::serve_site() or from 'Addins' menu.  This updates the public folder.
3. Within bash shell of public repository folder, stage, commit, and push to github.
